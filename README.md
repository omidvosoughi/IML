# Interpretable Machine Learning: Exercise 01.

Solve the tasks within exercise.ipynb to complete this weeks exercise.


## Instructions

Hint: If you have already completed the instructions in a previous exercise, you are invited to
reuse the environment and start from point 5.

1. Look up your ErgebnisPIN from the iML lecture inside studip. Change the content in
   `ergebnispin.txt` accordingly. Please do NOT mention any other information like name or matrikelnummer.
2. Install the open-source-distribution [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
3. Create a [new environment and activate
  it](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). If you
   already created an environment for a previous exercise, feel free to reuse it and continue with
   point four.
4. Inside this environment, install pip with `conda install pip`.
5. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
6. Open jupyter notebook with `jupyter notebook` and open the file `exercise.ipynb`. Alternatively,
  some programs offer integrated jupyter notebook editor.
7. Test all of your solutions with `pytest test.py` (if available).
8. Push your solution to your repository.

It's mandatory to not add or remove any cells.
